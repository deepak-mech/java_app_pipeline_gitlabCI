# java_app_pipeline_gitlabCI
This project is all about creating the different-different pipelines for the java application to automate the builiding application process, multiple tests before deployment & then deploy the application using CI/CD pipeline tool Gitlab.
Finally I published the test reports in HTML web page using Gitlab.

## The whole script for pipeline is written in file .gitlab-ci.yml.
